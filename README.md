## Developer Portfolio Landing Page Template

### Introduction

As a part of the FinTech Focus program, I created a financial trivia quiz website. In this program, we went through a two-week long bootcamp led by Bank of America software engineers, where we learned full-stack skills using Python-Flask and HTML/CSS. 
The website featured a home page with a navbar that when clicked, will take you to a new page. The website also included a page that displayed cards with financial knowledge and the final page on the website included a quiz that allowed users to submit their answer choices and get their score, the answers they got wrong, and the correct answers.
